### Health Misinformation on Social Media.

Although at present there is broad agreement among researchers, health professionals, and policy makers on the need to control and combat health misinformation, the magnitude of this problem is still unknown. Consequently, it is fundamental to discover both the most prevalent health topics and the social media platforms from which these topics are initially framed and subsequently disseminated. This project opens one of our main lines of research in the study of health misinformation in social media, as well as its effects on the health of the population. Specifically, we employ new social media mining techniques to characterize the topics on which health misinformation is based, such as vaccines, epidemics, chronic diseases and health treatments, the use of drugs and new tobacco products, miracle diets, etc.
