### Methodological Innovations in Social & Health Sciences (MISS).

Much of CS2 Datalab's activity is focused on the development and application of innovative methods both in the field of social sciences and health sciences. The methods employed range from quantitative to qualitative, including also mixed methods approaches. We employ and develop multivariate analysis techniques (regression analysis, clustering, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, multilevel, latent class models, among others), network analysis, social simulation, textual analysis techniques (topic and sentiment analysis), machine learning and deep learning.
