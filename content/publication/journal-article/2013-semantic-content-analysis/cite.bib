abstract = {In order to obtain a better understanding of the change of opinions and attitudes of the Spanish toward immigrants (Cea D'Ancona, 2004, 2007), this study analyzes the evolution of the media discourse referring to immigration in three Spanish newspapers: El Pa{\'{i}}s, El Mundo and La Vanguardia (2000-2008). In this work, a novel technique of semantic content analysis is applied to detect significant shifts in this discourse. The results show clear evidences of the evolution of the discourse regarding the immigration and its association with security issues and the demand for political solutions.},
