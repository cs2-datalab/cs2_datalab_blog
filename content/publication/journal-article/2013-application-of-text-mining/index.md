abstract: "The growing availability of online information highlights the need of techniques for the study of large volumes of textual data. This paper examines some possibilities of automatic techniques for textual analysis (text mining) to the field of social sciences and, specifically, to communications studies. In this manuscript, we present a case study to show in an applied manner how these methods and techniques for text analysis can be used for automatic content-characterization and description of textual framing in newspaper articles."
