I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Cadiz. In my 3 years of work experience at the university I have been part of some research projects, collaborating with statistical work through my training as a Mathematician. My thesis project is about the development of a measurement scale to measure the main risk factors in obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years old. My research interests are mainly:

+ Quantitative Research and Multivariate Methods
+ Psychometrics
+ Public Health
