Our team is composed by professors and researchers from different departments that are part of the
University Institute of Research for Social Sustainable Development (INDESS) at the University of Cadiz
(UCA). CS2 is conceived as an open-access multidisciplinary research forum, where social and
behavioural scientists, mathematicians, health researchers, humanities scientists, physicists, and computer
scientists share knowledge and cooperate side-by-side to come up with innovative solutions and theory-
grounded models to explain complex social phenomena.
